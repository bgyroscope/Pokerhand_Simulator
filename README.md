# Pokerhand_Simulator

Simple program that estimates the probability of winning given number of players and the cards in hand and on table. Note it doesn't take into account that fact that players with bad hands will be more likely to fold. 


Go to line 120 in main.py for relavant parameters (after iniital functions) 
recall h,s,d,c for suit, 2-9, T,J,Q,K,A for rank. Cards are indicated by a comma separated string.  
So for example, to input pocket hand of a 9 of hearts and 10 of Hearts use ' h9, hT'
